    <p class="indent">He is a manager in Finance and Corporate Services at the City of Ottawa. He grew up in the mountain village of Kisii in Kenya. He is my father. My father is not the man that will spend a lot of tim on rather long lectures, he is more likely to lead by example. For this reason, I have decided to add below some of my most cherished lessons learned from his example.</p>
    <h3> Top 4 Lessons from Andrew Kerandi to his Daughters</h3>
    <table class="table">
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>  </th>
          <th>Lesson</th>
          <th>What it Means</th>

      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <th>1</th>
          <td>It's Not Over Until It's Over</td>
          <td>Never back down from a situation that seems hopeless if you can find the slightest reason to have hope instead. Try every avenue for success. You just might struck gold.</td>
          <td>I continually watched my father go from booth to booth at the <a href="https://www.runottawa.ca/">Ottawa Race weekend</a> in 2016 to see if they would allow us to compete in the 5K, even if we were already 40 minutes late. We didn't get to compete but we got very close, even after multiple let downs at which I suggested we give up and go home.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>2</th>
          <td>Knowledge is Your Passport</td>
          <td>Education is not just a path; it's your passport to endless opportunities. Cherish it, for it will guide you to a future as bright as the sun.</td>
          <td>My father is a first-generation graduate from university. None of his parents participated in higher eductaion. Not only did he pursue a bachelor's degree but he also pursued a <a href="https://ruor.uottawa.ca/bitstream/10393/32462/3/Kerandi_Andrew_Maranga_2015_thesis.pdf">PHD with the University of Ottawa in Public Administration that is accessible online.</a> His continuous strive for excellence in his education is part of what allowed for him to take part in the immigration process to Canada, giving me the life I have today.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>3</th>
          <td>Confidence is Key</td>
          <td>Confidence is not merely a trait; it's the key that unlocks doors to endless opportunities. With unwavering belief in yourself, others will begin to believe in you too.</td>
          <td>My father has repeatedly told me: "You must believe you can do it to acheive success, that is step 1." His advice for Job interviews is to be so confident that you're a perfect fit for the role that the recruiter thinks it was their idea.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>4</th>
          <td>Embrace Correction and Change</td>
          <td> Embracing correction and change is not admitting defeat; it's planting the seed of growth. By welcoming feedback and being open to change, you nourish your potential, allowing it to blossom into something even more beautiful and resilient.</td>
          <td>My father used to be a very stubborn person but over the years, I've noticed how he's opened himself up to correction, criticism and opinions from people he knows love him.</td>
        </tr>
        </tbody>

   <p>As can be seen, through these my father is a force to be reckoned with. </p>
